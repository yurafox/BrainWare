# BrainWare Order List

This is a very small sample web application written in a very simplistic manner.

Grab the code and refactor it so that it meets your standard for production ready code.

There is no need to add additional functionality and you do not need to keep the existing code or project structure.

The only requirement is that it returns the list of orders and that it meets your standards!

## Changes for Running Locally

Update the connection string in the class <project root>\Web\Infrastructure\Database.cs.

Change the AttachDbFile name to the full path of the BrainWare.mdf file (located under <project root>\Web\App_Data\).
